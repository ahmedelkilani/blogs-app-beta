# Documentation

Please use the [existing Superfish documentation](http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/).

**Important note:** As of Superfish v1.5.1 if you wish to use hoverIntent you will need to use a [patched version that supports event delegation](https://github.com/joeldbirch/onHoverIntent).
